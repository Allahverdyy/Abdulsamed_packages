# Text Animation Example

This Flutter application is a simple example that demonstrates text animations using the [animated_text_kit](https://pub.dev/packages/animated_text_kit) package.

## Features

- Animated text display.
- Repeating animations for text with customizable pause durations.
- Support for customizing text styles.

## How to Use

1. Add the `animated_text_kit` package to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file as follows:

```yaml
dependencies:
  animated_text_kit: ^latest_version
```
OR 

2. Go to the visual stuido code terminal:

```
flutter pub add animated_text_kit
```
3. Add the `abdulsamed_package_1` package to your project. (Learn how to add your package at the project level [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages)).

4. Create a file named `abdulsamed_package_1.dart` in your `lib` folder and include the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_text_kit/animated_text_kit.dart';

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Text Animation Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedTextKit(
            animatedTexts: [
              TypewriterAnimatedText(
                'CHAT-GPT THANK YOU',
                textStyle: TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 36.0,
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                ),
                speed: Duration(milliseconds: 200),
              ),
            ],
            totalRepeatCount: 3, // Repeat the animation 3 times
            pause: Duration(milliseconds: 1000), // Pause for one second between each repetition
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

4. Use the necessary Flutter commands to run your application.
